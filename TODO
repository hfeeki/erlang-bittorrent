TODO
- Looks like the problem now is that we're reaching the end game and transmission won't ask for
  pieces just based on bitfield any more.
  - Need to keep track of the incoming have messages
  - At the end start sending have messages to finish them up
- Eventually have a sender process that takes requests in it's mailbox
  and just loops through them sending them out. Maybe.
