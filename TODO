TODO
- Send a piece
  - Write the send call write into the request function
  - Eventually have a sender process that takes requests in it's mailbox
    and just loops through them sending them out
- Implement piece message
  - Piece index and block offset come straight from the request
  - I guess the block data comes from reading the file?
