TODO
- It looks like sometimes the messages will come through split across multiple
  messages. Kinda like how sometimes there are multiple messages all in one. So
  I guess this means the packet receiving shit is going to have to change.
- Eventually have a sender process that takes requests in it's mailbox
  and just loops through them sending them out. Maybe.
